# Monitoring Zones and Endpoints configuration: Master node

NetEye comes with a default Endpoint name, that does not correspond to your FQDN. This is a problem when deploying Agents not able to resolve that name.
Therefore we need to:
- change the name of the Endpoint
- Generate the certificates
- Validate configuration and align your director configuration

__Remember Master vs. Satellite configuration__
*Service Name:	icinga2-master.service*
*ConfigDir:		/neteye/shared/icinga2/conf/icinga2*


Define Hostname in /etc/hosts
```
192.168.11.72   neteye4_trainer_master.neteye.lab  neteye4_trainer_master
192.168.11.73   neteye4_trainer_satellite.neteye.lab  neteye4_trainer_satellite
```

Define Hostname and Zone in constants.conf
```
const NodeName = "neteye4_trainer_master"
const ZoneName = "master"
```

__Breaking note:__ The local endpoint "icinga2-master.neteyelocal" is used by director api. Removing this will break connection and a manual re-configuration is required. To avoid this: ADD FIRST the new Endpoint, synchronize Director API and only THEN REMOVE the local endpoint.



__1. Leave existing endpoint in zones.conf and add the new hostname of master / relocative node__
```
#This is the new Endpoint
object Endpoint "neteye4_trainer_master" {
}
#This is the Endpoint to remove
object Endpoint "icinga2-master.neteyelocal" {
}
object Zone "master" {
   endpoints = [ "icinga2-master.neteyelocal", "neteye4_trainer_master" ]
}
```

__2. Generate certificates for each icinga2 satellite__

Note: Generate and sign certificates where icinga2-master service is running!
Certificate creation for new endpoint:
- Create certificate for new hostname and `.csr` (signing request)
- Sign certificate request with icinga2-master service
```
# cd /neteye/shared/icinga2/data/lib/icinga2/certs/
# export icinga_node_name="neteye4vm1.yourdomain.local"
# icinga2 pki new-cert --cn "${icinga_node_name}" --key "${icinga_node_name}.key" --cert "${icinga_node_name}.crt" --csr "${icinga_node_name}.csr"
# icinga2-master pki sign-csr --csr ${icinga_node_name}.csr --cert ${icinga_node_name}.crt
```

__3. Validate and reload Icinga2-master:__
```
# /usr/sbin/icinga2-master daemon --validate
```

See Problems from icinga2 log
```
# journalctl -u icinga2-master
```

Restart icinga2-master service
```
# systemctl restart icinga2-master.service
```

__4. Align Director and monitoring__
Synchronize Director to Icinga2 Infrastructure defining now the new Endpoint name
Icinga Director -> Infrastructure -> Kickstart Wizard

__5. Remove old Endpoint definition__
Return to zones.conf and remove the old local endpoint "icinga2-master.neteyelocal" from zones conf.
Now run Director Kickstart wizard to align as done in Step. 4.
