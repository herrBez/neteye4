# NetEye 4 Community Portal

Welcome to the community repository for NetEye 4 users. 
This repository comes with the purpose to share the best-practices and enhancements created by our userbase. Started as initiative during the first projects, it provides now a platform to accelerate any implementation project by providing:
- how-to documentations for setup and configuration of a NetEye 4
- monitoring templates such as host- or service templates, commands and fields
- additional monitoring plugins (scripts in part linked to 3rd party repositories)
- sample configurations to automate the configuration of best-practice configurations

## Getting started guide for NetEye 4
This repo guides you through the following steps of NetEye. Depending on the status of your NetEye 4 project it is suggested to go through both steps:
1. [setup the OS of a fresh standalone NetEye 4](/doc/020_os_configuration.md)
2. [Initialize the NetEye 4 resources (Standalone)](/doc/030_neteye_standalone_init.md)
3. [Configure monitoring zoning architecture](/doc/031_monitoring_zones_master.md)
4. [integration and autosetup of templates, monitoring plugins and sample configurations](/doc/050_community_configs_init.md)
